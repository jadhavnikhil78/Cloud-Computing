Spark Apriori Algorithm Execution Steps using AWS EMR Cluster:

1. Download the .zip file from 1. Download the .zip file from http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/07_Exercise_SparkAssociationRules.zip

2. Extract the .zip file

3. This .zip file contains the source code(SparkAssociationRules.zip), the executable 'SparkAssociationRules.jar' file and data files inside the 'Data' folder 

4. Create a cluster with Hadoop and Spark in AWS and start the cluster. Once the cluster is running, log-in to the master node using Putty(Windows) or SSH(MAC or Linux)

5. Create a data bucket in AWS S3. Upload SampleData.txt, CarData.txt and SparkAssociationRules.jar files to S3

6. From the master node download SparkAssociationRules.jar using the command:
	aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/SparkAssociationRules.jar .

7. Run the program using the command: 
	spark-submit --class org.Apriori.Driver ./SparkAssociationRules.jar s3://BUCKET_NAME/CarData.txt MINIMUM_SUPPORT_VALUE MINIMUM_CONFIDENCE_VALUE s3://BUCKET_NAME/SparkAssociationRulesOutput

8. Download the output folder(SparkSQLOutput) from S3 to your local machine

9. Execute the program for both CarData.txt and SampleData.txt

9. Upload the downloaded folder along with all commands, results and errors if any from the terminal window to Canvas
